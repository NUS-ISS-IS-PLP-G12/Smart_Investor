## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Swings in the market caused by the uncertainty and volatility from the Covid-19 have led to more people getting into the stock market and starting their investment journey. Brokers and experts in the field said there was an increase in the number of people trading and investing in the first half of this year, as they sought to take advantage of a market correction.

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) noted that since February, 2020, the monthly number of Central Depository (CDP) account openings has seen an increase compared with the same month in the previous year, with a particular spike observed in March to June, 2020. The volatility also drove total securities market turnover value up, causing it to jump by 124 per cent year on year in March to $48.2 billion, the report said, while the securities daily average value rose 114 per cent year on year to $2.2 billion. The market turnover value of exchange-traded funds (ETF) increased more than eight times year on year to $1.2 billion.

Standard Chartered Bank Singapore said it has seen a 200 per cent growth in trading volumes and a 20 per cent increase in account applications for the bank's online trading platform in the first half of this year. Mr. Mark Chia, the bank's head of managed investments and equities, said: "The Covid-19 pandemic has triggered a liquidity-driven market rally amidst unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy stimulus. Investors are also becoming more financially savvy. They are familiar with investment concepts such as 'buying on dips' and 'dollar-cost averaging'.

From all the news above, it is obvious that more and more people invest a large potion of their deposit into stock market. And, when analysts, investors and institutional traders evaluate current stock prices, news plays an important role in the valuation process. In fact, news carries information about the firm's fundamentals and qualitative information influencing expectations of market participants. From a theoretical point of view, an efficient valuation of a firm should reflect the present value of the firm's expected future cash flows. The expectations on the firm's development are crucially dependent on the information set that is available to investors. The information set consists of news that contains qualitative as well as quantitative information from various sources, e.g., corporate disclosures, third party news articles and analyst reports. If financial news conveys novel information leading to adjusted expectations about either firm's cash flows or investor's discount rates, it affects stock returns. 

In the news, not only financial figures have a significant impact on stock price, but also the qualitative textual components impact stock prices when containing new information. Therefore, in this project, various NLP tools has been taken to deal with news data so as to help investor make more reasonable decision.
